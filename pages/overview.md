## Description

This course is an introduction to coding for data analysis.

Coding is a fundamental skill for modern research.  Learning to code gives you
enormous power and flexibility for data analysis.  It will also give you tools
for deeper understanding of data analysis and statistics.

## What we cover

*   Data analysis through coding - "data science".
*   Simple programming with Python and standard Python libraries.
*   Loading data.
*   Selecting and exploring data.
*   Plotting data.
*   Simulation and basic statistical inference.

## We've taught this before

Some students worry that they will find the coding part of the course too
difficult.  But â€” take heart.  The course we are teaching here, we and others
have taught before to other students, like you.  This course is a shortened
version of a popular [course for undergraduates in all subjects in
Berkeley](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data-8), and we have also
taught this course to masters students and second year undergraduates in
Birmingham.  So, when we say, don't worry, we say it knowing that, if you hang
in there and do the work, you'll be OK.  And you'll have an invaluable skill
for your future career.

## Resources

We will be following the online class textbook at
<https://lisds.github.io/textbook>.

Please consider further background reading (see the background reading page).

## Tools

This course uses [Python and the Jupyter
Notebook](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/intro/the_software.html).
You do not need to install anything on your computer; we have set up a system
to run Python / Jupyter in the cloud so you can do your work in the cloud, via
a web browser.

## Policies

See the policies on working together.  Please make sure you read and understand
that page; it covers collaboration (very good!) and straight copying of work
(very bad!).
