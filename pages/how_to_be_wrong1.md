A key skill in data analysis is learning how to worry about being wrong.

Throughout the course, we will ask you to think about examples where you or
other reasonable people have drawn the wrong conclusions about data.

You can think of these as *data fails* where it proved very easy to draw the wrong conclusion, sometimes with disastrous consequences.

To prepare for the first session, go to [The Gapminder
certificate test](https://upgrader.gapminder.org/c/sdg-world-un-goals/).  This
is a quiz about the current state of the world, as measured in various ways.

The certificate test asks you to repeat the answers until you get them all right.  You can do that if you want, or just click next question when you get one wrong.

*While you are answering the questions*, write down any question that that
surprised you, and the answer you gave.   Click on the *More* button on the question to get more information about that question.

At the end, select the question where the answer was most surprising *to you*.

Now consider the following questions:

* What information were you using when you gave your answer?
* Why did you have the wrong information?  Or what information were you missing, and why?
* How could you have got the right information to answer the question?

We will discuss these in groups, in the class.
