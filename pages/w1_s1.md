This is the first synchronous session.

Some quick notes on:

* [Ode to code](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/code-basics/to_code.html)
* [Surviving the computer](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/intro/surviving_computers.html)

Next we discuss the first preparation exercise - the [Gapminder certificate
test](https://upgrader.gapminder.org/c/sdg-world-un-goals/).  For each:

* What information were you using when you gave your answer?
* Why did you have the wrong information?  Or what information were you missing, and why?
* How could you have got the right information to answer the question?

Next we introduce code and data, using the interactive Jupyter notebook system.

We will cover some of the material in these textbook pages:
