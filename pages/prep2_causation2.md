A central part of data science is learning how to draw valid conclusions from
data.

At the heart of many of our questions about data is the question of *causality*
— does the data tell us that one thing *cause* another.  Does smoking *cause*
lung cancer?  Does the Covid vaccine *cause* infertility?

These types of questions are particularly deep and difficult, and you will find
yourself struggling with them for the rest of your career as a data scientist
and a citizen.

Please take the time to read this material carefully; thinking about causality
is very hard, and you will see many mistakes in this type of thinking.  You
will make many mistakes yourself.

To begin, we follow the The Berkeley EdX course on one famous and extraordinary
moment in the discovery of cause and effect in disease — John Snow and the
cause of cholera.

Go to the The Berkeley EdX course (see the Cortex link for instructions).

Find Week 1, Section 2 — Cause and Effect.

Watch:

* Lec 2.2: Association
* Lec 2.3: Causation
* Lec 2.4: Confounding

Next read [Chapter 2: Causality and
Experiments](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/02/causality-and-experiments.html)
from the Berkeley textbook, to go over the material in more depth.

Finally, go through the section "Reading and Practice for Section 2", and
answer the questions there.

We will continue with some more questions on this reading in class next week.
