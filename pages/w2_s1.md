This is the first session for week 2:

## Causation

Consider [this page on the London Homeopathic
Hospital](https://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/homeopathic.html).

Was homeopathy a good treatment for cholera?  Is it a good treatment now?  How
would we know?

For reference, the [Australian National Health and Medical Research Council
statement on
homeopathy](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/sites/default/files/images/nhmrc-statement-on-homeopathy.pdf).

[Cancer and fluoride in drinking water](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45159668).
For the rather equivocal evidence of benefit from water fluoridation see this
[Cochrane review on water
fluoridation](https://www.cochrane.org/CD010856/ORAL_water-fluoridation-prevent-tooth-decay).
