The exercise is on the cloud system at [Race
policing](https://ds.lis.2i2c.cloud/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/lisds/race_policing&subPath=race_policing.ipynb).

Fill it out on the cloud system.

Then follow the instructions in the "Submitting notebooks" page to save the
`.ipynb` file to your computer, and upload that file here.

Read the instructions in the exercise carefully, and the instructions in the
"Submitting notebooks".

Remember â€” we will be covering much relevant material in week 4, and the
beginning of week 5, so don't be surprised if the assessment looks unfamiliar
at the beginning of week 4.
