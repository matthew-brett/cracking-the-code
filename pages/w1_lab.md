As in each week, we will finish with a lab session, were you can work at your
own speed on exercises for material during the week.

You can work in pairs for the labs, and in fact, we recommend that you do.
There is some evidence that working in pairs can improve learning for
programming, and especially when the pair have different levels of prior
experience.

The exercise is [Reading Count
